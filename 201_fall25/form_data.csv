This summer, I worked as a research assistant at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, where I supported the development of a novel dataset tracking physician merger and acquisition activity, then analyzed healthcare consolidation impacts on Medicare/Medicaid care quality. During the summer, I taught myself some fundamentals of data analysis and programming in R out of necessity. That said, the experience definitely highlighted how much I would benefit from a more formal Statistics education, given my strong interest in public health economics. ","In my aforementioned work at Berkeley this summer, I was attempting to model the amount of physician M&A activity in each month of the year. I noticed our data showed that materially more M&A activity was occurring in January than in other months. However, when I dug into this finding, I realized we were defaulting to listing 1/1/#### as the acquisition date for all private equity acquisitions for which the press release did not provide a precise date. When I brought this up to my supervisor, we ended up creating a flag feature in our dataset for these ambiguous cases, which helped us avoid the conclusion that private equity firms really like to make acquisitions during the middle of winter :). This moment, as well as countless other moments from this summer, showed me the value of PRECISION and careful consideration of nitty gritty details.
