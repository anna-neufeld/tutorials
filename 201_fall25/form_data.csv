During the summer, I taught myself some fundamentals of data analysis and programming in R out of necessity. That said, the experience definitely highlighted how much I would benefit from a more formal Statistics education, given my strong interest in public health economics. ","In my aforementioned work at Berkeley this summer, I was attempting to model the amount of physician M&A activity in each month of the year. I noticed our data showed that materially more M&A activity was occurring in January than in other months. However, when I dug into this finding, I realized we were defaulting to listing 1/1/#### as the acquisition date for all private equity acquisitions for which the press release did not provide a precise date. When I brought this up to my supervisor, we ended up creating a flag feature in our dataset for these ambiguous cases, which helped us avoid the conclusion that private equity firms really like to make acquisitions during the middle of winter :).

Nonetheless, I've heard from my friends and especially my Dad how useful it is, especially for my intended majors of mathematics and economics, and even my potential career path in finance. However I may use it, I'm excited!","Recently, my friend Rex and I were talking about the massive Powerball jackpot that has climbed to around $1.7 billion. He joked that this might be the ""best"" time to buy a ticket statistically, since the prize was so high compared to the odds. But, the odds of a player selecting all six numbers are 1 in 292.2 million. Maybe he meant winning any prize, which is just 1 in 24.9. Overall, what caught my attention was the way that he talked about probability without understanding all the factors. This reminded me of our discussion in class the other day about the difficulty of making inferences with confounding variables.","I spent a lot of time working with graphs and datasets this summer during my private equity internship to analyze macrotrends across the various industries which the companies I was evaluating fit into. This included data on exports, company KPIs, consumer preferences of products, and more. I would be interested in continuing to work with these kinds of datasets.",Sophomore,2,"No, I have no programming experience!","I'm not necessarily nervous, but I do acknowledge my lack of experience in computer science and unfamiliarity with stats as a subject.","Thursday 6-10, Sunday 6-10",N/A,"Mondays 2:30-3:30, Thursdays 1:30-2:30",,1,4-8,6-10,7,71 inches,Yes,No,Goodrich,Paresky,No,2,0,Sawyer side

However, I also find data analysis really interesting and am excited to get to apply that interest within a Williams course. ","In my Stats class senior year, we conducted a survey to answer the research question: does the class year of Holy Names students have a correlation to whether or not they did their summer reading? We took a random sample of I believe 30 students from each grade. Our survey collected categorical information, which we turned into a bar graph with proportions. This was an interesting project to me because it was something I as an individual could relate to and was curious about finding an answer to.","Recently, I have been working on a stock pitch for an investment conference and so financial data has been interesting to me at the moment (although I know many of those tend to be summaries).",Sophomore,1,"No, but I have taken other programming courses.","Honestly, the programming because I do not love coding haha",Sunday 6-10,n/a,Mondays 2:30-3:30,"Monday 11am-12pm, Tuesday 2:30-4pm, Wednesday 10am-11am, Wednesday 2pm-4pm",0,8,6,0,61,Yes,Yes,Spring street market iced vanilla latte with a shot of caramel,Paresky,No,2,0,Schow side

I thought 201 was the perfect solution for me because it is still intro stat but at a higher intensity level and since it will help me complete my major all at the same time. ","One moment that stands out to me the most is from my first year on the field hockey team at Williams. One of the seniors on the team, who I got pretty close with by the end of the year because our coach made us ""buddies,"" was a stats major at Williams and she would always use her stats knowledge to try to predict the outcomes of games and how final brackets would work out between the teams in our league ahead of time. We didn't rely on her or expect her to get the right answer every time, but it was both fun and fascinating to watch her be able to apply what she was doing in the classroom to a real world example and another part of her life. I was interested by this example because it made me realize more clearly that the things we are learning every day actually do apply to the real world, and I am excited to start learning some of the statistics she was using to predict our season outcomes!",I don't really know anything about datasets (and honestly what you mean by what types of datasets) but I like the idea of learning something about Williams College students because then I could see firsthand how the statistical analysis we use in the classroom can be used and applied to real world situations that I am actually a part of (ex. does what building you study in at night affect GPA and questions like that).,Junior,5,"No, but I have taken other programming courses.","I would say I am mostly just nervous that I will feel lost in statistics, even the most basic concepts, because I have never taken it before at all, but I am hopeful that my math background will help me grasp concepts more quickly. And, I am also hopeful that the problem solving techniques that I have acquired in math classes will carry over to this class and help me work through problems when I get stuck.

9/6/2025 1:01:15,as74@williams.edu,Ahmed Salah,Ahmed,He/Him'His,"To be honest, I got into it mostly for fun. Back in high school, I took pure math classes alongside mechanics and statistics — they always seemed to complement each other in a truck load of magnificent ways. I also worked on two data analysis projects from a CS perspective, where we had to handle outlier, erroneous data and calculate all sorts of things, like a Pearson's coefficient. I remember thinking, “WHA -- where did that formula even come from?” I want to have those ""Aha"" moments. I want to understand how statistical methods are derived — not just how to use them, but why and how they work. One thing that really intrigued me was the approximation from a normal distribution to a binomial one. Why do we do that? I wanted to dig into the reasoning behind those kinds of decisions.
Finally, I hope to major in Physics.","2 years ago, I saw a movie dataset on Kaggle that compiled information from cinemas using the ""Rotten tomatoes"" API. It included over a hundred film with details like release dates, user ratings, vote counts, popularity scores and not to mention - directors — all ripe for statistical analysis. What fascinated me was how you could visualize trends over time, like how certain genres gained popularity and who were the top 10 most popular directors of all time by ratings. It made me realize how statistics can uncover hidden patterns in something as everyday as the movies we watch.","Anything that has interesting insights, except for college admissions.",First year,0,"No, but I have taken other programming courses.","Maybe falling behind when we get to the harder topics?
