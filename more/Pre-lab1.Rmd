# First Prelab
### Getting started
This is my first Pre lab. I want to see if I can create a PDF document that contains text and R code.

```{r}
5+8
```
When I knit this, hopefully my PDF document will contain the printed number 13!! 

### More advanced
Let's try one more chunk!
```{r}
x = 5+7
y = 10-3
x-y
```

What do you see in the PDF document?
